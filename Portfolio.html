    <img src="Headshot1.jpg" width="430" height="600">
        <p>Greetings! My name is Sabrina and welcome to my portfolio. By trade, I have a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering.
            I love to build and create things: 3D models, 3D printing, websites, apps, etc. I am currently working towards a certification to be a 
            full-stack developer to round out my love of creating things; I'll understand the coding behind my work and also be able to
            build and work with the physical aspects. When I'm not creating and working, I enjoy international and domestic travel with family and
            friends, spending time with my cat, reading, etc. Enjoy the rest of my page and thanks for stopping by! If you are interested in contacting
            me directly, please see below on how to get in touch.
        </p>
