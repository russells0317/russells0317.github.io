# MIT xPRO Portfolio Assignment
## Description of Assignment
This was an assignment to begin creating a portfolio to show employers the skills and projects that have been created. This assignment showcases the coding capabilities using 3 projects: Eye Movement, PacMan, and the Real Time Bus Tracker. Using Bootstrap, the creation of a website and a layout with a navigation bar is viewable and interactive. There is a short YouTube video embedded into the webpage to provide a brief overview of my skills, job history, and job roles. 
## How to Run: 
In order to view this website, download all the files to a singular location. Open a browser window and drag the Bootstrap.html file to the window and begin interacting with the website UI. 
## Roadmap: 
As the course progresses, it is important to keep this website up to date on the projects worked on. I plan to continue improving the UI of this website and adding more projects to showcase my work.
